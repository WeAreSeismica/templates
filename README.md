# TeX templates for Seismica

This repository contains LaTeX templates for [Seismica](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca).

**IF YOU ARE AN AUTHOR:** use the **submission template** to format your article. You can also find this template on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/seismica/bvnbjbkycdjb). It compiles with pdflatex.

Using our template is not required for initial submission but is required if your article is accepted for publication. The submission template produces a PDF that is suitable for preprinting.


## Submission\_latex
Contains Latex submission templates, and should be mirrored on Overleaf. It compiles with pdflatex.

The template includes the class file `seismica.cls`, the bib style file `abbrvnat_seismica_upcasetitle.bst` which describes citation formatting, the first page banner image `banner.png`, a placeholder image `empty.png`, and a sample article `seismica_template.tex` and bibfile `mybibfile.bib`. Authors should use the sample article and bibfile as a base for formatting their articles. 

Note that the sample article file contains some instructions on how to use this template (and how *not* to use it). You can also look at Seismica's [Author Guidelines](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/author-guidelines) and our [templates page](https://seismica.library.mcgill.ca/templates/) for more guidance on puttiing together your manuscript.


## Publication\_latex
Contains Latex template for publication, for use by Seismica's Standards and Copyediting team. We're making it publicly available so anyone interested can see what it looks like it or adapt it for other purposes. It is not intended for the use of authors submitting to Seismica. Note that you can't fake an article using our template because you can't fake a DOI, but please just don't try.

The publication template compiles with LuaLatex (TeXLive version 2022 or older).
